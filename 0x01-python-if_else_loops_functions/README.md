# ALX TASKS: 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

## Task 0: Positive or Negative
Write a Python program that assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. Print whether the number is positive, zero, or negative.

## Task 1: The Last Digit
Write a Python program that assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` and prints the last digit of the number along with specific conditions based on the last digit.

## Task 2: Alphabet Game
Write a Python program that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, not followed by a new line, using only one print function and one loop. No characters should be stored in a variable, and no modules should be imported.

## Task 3: Alphabet Soup
Write a Python program that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e'. Use one print function and one loop without storing characters in a variable or importing any modules.

## Task 4: Hexadecimal Printing
Write a Python program that prints numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal using one print function and one loop. No numbers or strings should be stored in variables, and no modules should be imported.

## Task 5: 00...99
Write a Python program that prints numbers from 0 to 99 separated by commas and spaces. Numbers should be printed in ascending order with two digits. Use no more than 2 print functions and one loop, and avoid storing numbers or strings in variables.

## Task 6: Different Combinations
Write a Python program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits, separated by commas and spaces. Numbers should be in ascending order, and the smallest combination of two digits should be printed. Use no more than 3 print functions and 2 loops without storing numbers or strings in variables or importing any modules.

## Task 7: islower Function
Write a function `islower(c)` that checks if a character is lowercase. Returns `True` if lowercase, `False` otherwise. Use the `ord()` function and avoid importing any modules.

## Task 8: To Uppercase Function
Write a function `uppercase(str)` that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line. Use no more than 2 print functions and one loop. Avoid importing modules and using `str.upper()`.

## Task 9: Print Last Digit Function
Write a function `print_last_digit(number)` that prints the last digit of a given number. Returns the value of the last digit. Avoid importing any modules.

## Task 10: Add Function
Write a function `add(a, b)` that adds two integers and returns the result. Avoid importing any modules.

## Task 11: Power Function
Write a function `pow(a, b)` that computes `a` to the power of `b` and returns the result. Avoid importing any modules.
